# dailyhues

Get an AI-extracted color palette with Bing's wallpaper of the day.

Here's an example of what you can do with the palette:

<img width="2560" height="1440" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/27e5fafc-2607-4419-a5e0-151d068fe6f2" />

## Usage

I host a public instance at [dailyhues.mgabor.hu](https://dailyhues.mgabor.hu) (for the `en-US` locale).

Use the API to get today's wallpaper and a matching color gradient. The palette is designed to always fit well with the wallpaper, and can be used for styling UI elements.

```sh
curl https://dailyhues.mgabor.hu/api/colors
```

Requests take about 30 seconds if noone has requested the wallpaper today (downloads wallpaper and asks AI for colors). Subsequent requests are instant (cached).

With the response data, you can:
  - Download the wallpaper for your screen size
  - Apply the gradient itself to the focused window's border
  - Apply any of the two colors as a highlight color for UI elements. `gradient_from` is meant to be used near the top of the screen (e.g. waybar), and `gradient_to` near the bottom

You can find a practical example for how I achieved this in my [dotfiles](https://github.com/mgabor3141/dots/blob/main/.local/bin/bing-wallpaper.sh) repository.

### Parameters

```sh
curl https://dailyhues.mgabor.hu/api/colors?locale=en-US&daysAgo=0
```

Both parameters are optional. `daysAgo` defaults to `0` (today), `locale` defaults to `en-US`.

`daysAgo` can be `0` (today), `1` (yesterday), up to `7` (7 days ago). Bing only keeps wallpapers for the last 7 days.
